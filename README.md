## Data ArchitectureProject Overview
This project involves:

Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
🎯 This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

![alt text](docs/Data_Architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## Project Requirement

### Building a Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective 

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications

- **Data Sources** : Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality** : Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration** : Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope** : Focus on latest dataset only; historization dataset is not required
- **Documentation** : Provide clear documentation for the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics team

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

#### Objective

Develop SQL-Based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business matrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
